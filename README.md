# HexKepler-Beta
Beta print files and instructions for the HexKepler automated print ejection system for Bambulab Printers! 

More detailed instructures are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cagRz-2Ejm0qv1Y2kZROePAQ3uDA_8M2JfiddhPycyg/edit?usp=sharing).

Files are in this github.

Don't worry, everything will become *far* more polished before the first public release. Thank you all for being willing to beta-test!

The gcodes are for my P1P, but I do not believe there are significant modifications for the X1C.

Oh, and I don't know much about this, but I feel like I should make a disclaimer that this is all beta, and everything here is absolutely at your own risk.
